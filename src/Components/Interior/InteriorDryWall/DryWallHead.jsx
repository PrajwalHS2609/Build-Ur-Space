        What Is a <span>Dry Wall Partition</span>?{" "}
      </h4>
      <p>
        A dry wall partition in Bangalore is a non-load-bearing wall made from
        gypsum board or similar materials that are attached to a metal or wooden
        framework. Unlike traditional brick walls, dry wall partitions are
        lightweight, making them easier and faster to install. They can be
        customized to fit any space and can include features such as windows and
        doors, allowing for an open yet defined atmosphere.
