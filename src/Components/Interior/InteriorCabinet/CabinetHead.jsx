        Modular cabinets in Bangalore for home are pre-fabricated storage
        solutions that can be customized and assembled according to your needs.
        Unlike traditional cabinets, which are often built as a single unit,
        modular cabinets are designed in separate pieces or modules. This
        modular approach allows for greater flexibility in design and
        installation, making it easier to fit these cabinets into various spaces
        and layouts.
