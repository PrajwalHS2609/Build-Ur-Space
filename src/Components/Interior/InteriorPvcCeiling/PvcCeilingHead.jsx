        What is a <span>PVC False Ceiling</span> ?{" "}
      </h4>
      <p>
        A PVC false ceiling in Bangalore is a suspended ceiling system made from
        polyvinyl chloride (PVC) panels. These panels are lightweight, durable,
        and available in a variety of designs and colors, making them an
        attractive choice for both residential and commercial spaces. The
        installation of a PVC false ceiling creates an air gap between the
        original ceiling and the new ceiling, allowing for the concealment of
        electrical wiring, plumbing, and HVAC ducts, while also providing
        thermal insulation.
