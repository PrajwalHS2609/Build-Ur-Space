      <h4>
        Why Choose a <span>Toughened Glass Partition</span> ?{" "}
      </h4>
      <p>
        A toughened glass partition in Bangalore combines strength, style, and
        safety in one package. Toughened glass, also known as tempered glass, is
        manufactured through a controlled thermal process that makes it four to
        five times stronger than standard glass. When broken, it shatters into
        small, blunt fragments, reducing the risk of injury. This durability,
        along with the modern look, makes it an ideal choice for partitioning
        spaces in homes, offices, and retail settings.
