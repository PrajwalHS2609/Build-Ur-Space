        largely depends on how well the space meets the needs of its tenants. At{" "}
        <a href="https://buildurspace.com/">Build Ur Space</a>, we focus on
        designing PG accommodations that offer both comfort and functionality.
        We consider factors such as room size, privacy, common areas, and
        amenities to create a living environment that is appealing to potential
        tenants. Our designs are optimized for space utilization, ensuring that
        each PG unit is both practical and inviting.
