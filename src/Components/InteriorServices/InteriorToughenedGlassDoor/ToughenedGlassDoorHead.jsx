        What is a <span>Toughened Glass Door</span> ?{" "}
      </h4>
      <p>
        Toughened glass, also known as tempered glass, is a type of safety glass
        that has been processed through controlled thermal treatments, making it
        up to four to five times stronger than regular glass. Unlike
        conventional glass, toughened glass doesnâ€™t shatter into sharp,
        dangerous shards when broken; instead, it crumbles into small,
        blunt-edged pieces, making it much safer in both residential and
        commercial settings. Our{" "}
