          Enhanced Safety{" "}
        </span>
        <p>
          Unlike standard glass, toughened glass undergoes a unique
          manufacturing process to create a door that will crumble into small,
          blunt pieces upon impact, making it much safer in the event of
          accidental breakage. This is particularly advantageous in environments
          with children, pets, or busy offices, where safety is a priority.
