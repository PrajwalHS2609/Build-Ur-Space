      <h5>2. Orientation of the Home: The Role of Cardinal Directions</h5>
      <p>
        According to Vastu, the orientation of your home determines the type and
        quality of energy flow within. The main entrance should ideally face the
        north, east, or northeast. This orientation invites in morning sunlight,
        which is believed to bring prosperity and happiness. South or
        west-facing entrances may bring less favorable results, but adjustments
        can be made with mirrors and reflective materials to remedy any
        imbalances.{" "}
