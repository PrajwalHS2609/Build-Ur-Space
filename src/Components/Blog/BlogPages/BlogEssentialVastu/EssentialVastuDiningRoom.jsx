        The dining room is best located in the west or south of the home, as
        this direction enhances digestion and family bonding. According to
        Vastu, family members should face the east or north while eating, as
        this promotes better health and digestion. Keep the dining area simple,
        clutter-free, and well-lit to foster a positive ambiance.
