        In Vastu, the kitchen represents the element of fire, so it should
        ideally be located in the southeast corner of the home. This direction
        is known to support the fire element and thus enhances the kitchen's
        purpose. If southeast isnâ€™t possible, northwest is the next best option.
        Additionally, place the stove in such a way that the cook faces east
        while cooking, as this is said to increase health and happiness. Vastu
        for home kitchen also recommends avoiding placing the kitchen under or
        adjacent to any bathroom, as water and fire elements may clash.
