      <h5>7. Bathroom and Toilet Placement: Balancing Energies</h5>
      <p>
        Bathrooms and toilets can disrupt the energy flow if not placed
        correctly. Ideally, they should be located in the northwest or southeast
        corners of the house. Avoid placing toilets or bathrooms in the
        northeast direction, as this can interfere with the positive energy
        flow. Make sure the bathroom door is always closed, and consider using
        colors like beige, light blue, or earthy tones to maintain a soothing,
        balanced atmosphere.
