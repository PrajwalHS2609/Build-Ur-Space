      <h5>1. Choosing the Right Plot: The Foundation of Good Vastu</h5>
      <p>
        The plot of land you select is one of the most critical elements of
        Vastu. Ideally, go for a plot that is either square or rectangular, as
        it allows for even energy distribution. Irregular shapes may disrupt the
        flow of positive energy, so if youâ€™re considering a unique shape,
        consult a Vastu expert to help with alignment. Ensuring the right shape
        and alignment is part of basic Vastu rules for home design.
