      <h5>3. Placement of the Main Door: Welcoming Positive Energy</h5>
      <p>
        The main door should be the largest door in the house and should open
        clockwise. Keep it clean, well-lit, and free from any clutter or
        obstruction, as this is where good fortune enters your home. A wooden
        main door is typically preferred in Vastu, as it provides both aesthetic
        appeal and positive energy flow. Additionally, avoid placing shoe racks
        or trash bins near the main entrance as they may disrupt the harmony.
