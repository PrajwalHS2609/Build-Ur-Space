      <h5>10. Lighting and Decor: Enhancing Positive Energy</h5>
      <p>
        Lighting plays a vital role in Vastu for home decor. Natural lighting is
        ideal, so maximize sunlight wherever possible, especially in the east
        and north-facing rooms. Place mirrors on the north or east walls to
        reflect positive energy and enhance lighting. When it comes to decor,
        avoid placing images that depict sadness or violence, and opt instead
        for symbols of prosperity, like lush plants or soft artwork.
