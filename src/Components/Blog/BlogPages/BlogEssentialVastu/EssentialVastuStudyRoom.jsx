      <p>
        If you have a dedicated study or work area, it should be positioned in
        the northeast or east direction for maximum productivity and focus.
        Vastu suggests placing your study table facing north or east to
        facilitate learning and creative thinking. Avoid placing the study room
        under a staircase or directly above or below a bathroom, as this may
        create distractions and disturbances.
