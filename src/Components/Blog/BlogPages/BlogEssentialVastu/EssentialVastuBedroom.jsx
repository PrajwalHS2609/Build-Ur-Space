      <h5>5. Bedroom Vastu: Rest and Rejuvenate in Comfort</h5>
      <p>
        For restful sleep and positive energy, position the bedroom in the
        southwest part of the house. The bed should be placed in such a way that
        when lying down, your head points towards the south. Avoid mirrors
        facing the bed, as Vastu suggests they may disturb your sleep and create
        a sense of restlessness. Soft, earthy tones in the bedroom can also
        enhance a sense of tranquility.
