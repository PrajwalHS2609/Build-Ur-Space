      <h5>Steps Involved in Duplex House Construction</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>1. Conceptualization and Design</span>
          <p>
            Begin with a blueprint that outlines the structure, layout, and
            design features of the duplex. Collaborate with your architect to
            incorporate your vision while adhering to practical constraints.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>2.Site Preparation</span>
          <p>
            Clear the land, level the ground, and prepare the site for
            construction. This stage involves excavation, laying the foundation,
            and ensuring the soil is stable.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>3. Foundation and Structural Framework</span>
          <p>
            A strong foundation is crucial for any building. The structural
            framework, including walls, columns, and beams, is then constructed
            to provide the skeleton of the house.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>4. Plumbing and Electrical Installations</span>
          <p>
            Proper installation of plumbing and electrical systems ensures
            functionality and safety. Plan for separate utilities for each unit
            to maintain independence.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>5. Roofing and Exterior Finishing</span>
          <p>
            Roofing and exterior finishing give the duplex its final shape.
            Choose durable materials that withstand local weather conditions
            while adding aesthetic appeal.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>6. Interior Work</span>
          <p>
            Interior finishes, such as flooring, painting, and cabinetry, are
            completed during this stage. Pay attention to details to create a
            cohesive and inviting ambiance.

        </li>
        <li>
          <span>7. Landscaping and Outdoor Spaces</span>

            Enhance the overall appeal of your duplex with well-designed outdoor
            spaces, such as gardens, driveways, or patios.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>8. Final Inspection and Handover</span>
          <p>
            Conduct a thorough inspection to ensure everything is in order.
            Address any discrepancies and hand over the property for use.
