      <h3>What is Duplex House Construction?</h3>
      <p>
        A duplex house is a residential structure with two separate living units
        under one roof. These units may share a common wall but have separate
        entrances, ensuring privacy. Duplex houses are popular for their
        dual-purpose functionality, serving as a single-family home or providing
        a rental income opportunity by leasing one unit.
