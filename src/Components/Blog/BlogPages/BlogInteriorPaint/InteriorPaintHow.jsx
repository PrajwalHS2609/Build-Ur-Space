      <h5>How to Choose the Right Home Interior Paint Colors</h5>
      <p>
        Selecting the best home interior paint colors involves more than picking
        your favorite shade. Here are expert tips to guide your decision:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <h4>1. Consider the Room’s Purpose</h4>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> For bedrooms, opt for calming colors
            like pastels or muted earth tones.
          </span>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> Kitchens and dining areas benefit
            from energetic hues like yellow or vibrant blue.
          </span>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> Living rooms can handle versatile
            shades like greige, sage green, or terracotta.
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h4>2. Test Before You Commit </h4>
        <p>
          Always test samples on your walls before making a decision. Observe
          how the colors look in different lighting throughout the day.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h4>3. Match the Décor </h4>
        <p>
           Ensure your paint colors complement your furniture,
          flooring, and accessories. A cohesive look enhances the overall
          appeal.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h4> 4. Think About Lighting </h4>
        <p>
         Natural light can make colors appear brighter,
          while artificial lighting might dull them. Keep this in mind when
          choosing shades for specific rooms.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h4>5. Use the Color Wheel</h4>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> Complementary colors (opposite each
            other on the wheel) add contrast and vibrancy.
          </span>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> Analogous colors (next to each other
            on the wheel) create a harmonious look.
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
