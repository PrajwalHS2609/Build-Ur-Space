      <h5>Steps Involved in PCC Concreting</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>1. Preparation of the Site</span>
          <p>
            The area where PCC will be applied is cleaned, leveled, and
            compacted to ensure a stable base.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>2. Formwork Installation</span>
          <p>
            Formwork is set up to contain the concrete and give it the desired
            shape.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>3. Mixing the Concrete</span>
          <p>
            The cement, sand, aggregate, and water are mixed in precise
            proportions to achieve the desired consistency and strength.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>4. Pouring and Spreading</span>
          <p>
            The concrete is poured into the prepared area and evenly spread
            using tools like trowels and rakes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>5. Compaction</span>
          <p>
            Vibrators or compactors are used to eliminate air pockets and ensure
            uniform density.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>6. Curing</span>
          <p>
            The concrete is kept moist for a specific period to enhance its
            strength and durability.
          </p>
