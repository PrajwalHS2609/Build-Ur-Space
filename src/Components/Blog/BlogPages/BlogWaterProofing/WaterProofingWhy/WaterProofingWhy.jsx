        Before diving into the top waterproofing materials for home, letâ€™s first
        understand why waterproofing is so crucial. Water infiltration can lead
        to severe damage over time, such as mold growth, structural
        deterioration, and foundation cracks. Not only does this affect the
        aesthetics of your home, but it can also cause health issues and require
        costly repairs.
