      <h5>Modern Kitchen Designs: Ideas for Every Style </h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>1. Minimalist Modern Kitchens</span>
          <p>
            If simplicity is your style, a minimalist modern kitchen is the way
            to go. Focus on neutral tones like white, grey, and beige. Use
            flat-panel cabinets and sleek appliances to maintain a streamlined
            look. Add a pop of color or texture with a bold backsplash or a
            statement light fixture.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>2. Industrial-Style Kitchens</span>
          <p>
            Industrial-style modern kitchen designs incorporate raw materials
            like exposed brick, metal finishes, and concrete countertops. Pair
            these with modern appliances and open shelving for a trendy yet
            functional kitchen.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>3. Scandinavian-Inspired Kitchens</span>
          <p>
            Scandinavian kitchens prioritize warmth and functionality. Light
            wood cabinets, pastel hues, and simple geometric patterns are the
            hallmarks of this design style. Add greenery or pendant lighting for
            a cozy touch.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>4. High-Tech Smart Kitchens</span>
          <p>
            Modern living often includes smart technology, and kitchens are no
            exception. Install smart appliances, touchless faucets, and
            automated lighting to create a high-tech space that aligns with
            modern kitchen designs.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>5. Eco-Friendly Kitchens</span>
          <p>
            Sustainability is a growing focus in modern kitchen designs. Use
            eco-friendly materials like bamboo or recycled glass for cabinets
            and countertops. Energy-efficient appliances and LED lighting are
            must-haves for an environmentally conscious kitchen.
