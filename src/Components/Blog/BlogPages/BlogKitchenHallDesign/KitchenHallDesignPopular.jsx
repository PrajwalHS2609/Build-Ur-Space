          <span>1. Neutral and Earthy Tones</span>
          <p>
            Neutral tones remain a favorite in modern kitchen designs, with
            earthy tones like terracotta and sage green making their way into
            kitchen hall designs for a natural and calming ambiance.

        <li>
          <span>2. Mixed Materials</span>
          <p>
            Combining materials like wood, metal, and stone adds depth and
            character to modern kitchens and halls. For instance, a wooden
            dining table paired with metal chairs can bridge the kitchen and
            hall seamlessly.
