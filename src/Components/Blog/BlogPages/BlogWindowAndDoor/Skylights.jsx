    <h5>10. Skylights: Letting Light in From Above </h5>
    <p>
      Skylights are an ideal choice for spaces with limited wall space, as
      they bring in light from above. Theyâ€™re popular in rooms like bathrooms,
      kitchens, and attics, where wall space is limited. The Latest Window
      Designs for House include automated and energy-efficient skylights,
      which make it easier to control the amount of light and ventilation.
