      <h5>1. Sliding Glass Doors: Bringing the Outdoors In </h5>
      <p>
        Sliding glass doors are a timeless favorite among modern homeowners.
        Their large glass panels allow for ample natural light, providing a
        seamless transition between indoor and outdoor spaces. Modern sliding
        doors have thin, durable frames made of materials like aluminum or steel
        that maximize the view, adding a minimalist touch thatâ€™s perfect for
        contemporary homes. These doors are also highly functional, making it
        easy to move between indoor and outdoor areas.
