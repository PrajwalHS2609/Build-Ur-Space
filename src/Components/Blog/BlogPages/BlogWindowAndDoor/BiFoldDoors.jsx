      <h5>4. Bi-Fold Doors: Versatile and Space-Saving</h5>
      <p>
        Bi-fold doors are an innovative choice in Modern Window & Door Designs
        that fold back in sections, creating an expansive opening. Theyâ€™re
        perfect for homes with large outdoor areas, as they fully open to blur
        the boundaries between indoors and outdoors. Bi-fold doors come in
        various frame materials, including aluminum and wood, and are often used
        in living rooms, dining rooms, and even kitchens to create a spacious
        atmosphere.
