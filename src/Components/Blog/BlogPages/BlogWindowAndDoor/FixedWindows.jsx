      <h5>8. Fixed Windows: Adding Light Without Ventilation </h5>
      <p>
        Fixed windows are stationary and do not open, making them ideal for
        rooms where ventilation is not a priority. These windows are often used
        in conjunction with other types of windows and are perfect for framing
        outdoor views or filling spaces with natural light. The Latest Window
        Designs for House offer creative fixed window shapes and configurations,
        adding visual interest without compromising on energy efficiency.
