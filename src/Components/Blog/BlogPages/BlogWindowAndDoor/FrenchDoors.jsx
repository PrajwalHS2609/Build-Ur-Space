      <h5>2. French Doors: Classic Meets Modern</h5>
      <p>
        French doors are a classic design that never goes out of style, now
        available with modern touches for todayâ€™s homes. Traditional French
        doors have glass panes extending the entire length, bringing in plenty
        of light while providing a touch of elegance. They are commonly used as
        patio doors or even interior doors between rooms, offering versatility
        in design.
