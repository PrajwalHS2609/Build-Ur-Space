      <h5>4. Potential Delays in Building a 30x40 Feet House in Bangalore</h5>
      <p>
        While itâ€™s possible to complete the construction of a 30x40 Feet House
        in Bangalore within the estimated timeline, several factors could lead
        to delays:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> Weather:
          </span>
          <p>
            As mentioned, Bangalore experiences heavy rains during the monsoon
            season, which can delay outdoor construction activities.

            <img src={point} alt="point" /> Labor Shortages:
          </span>
          <p>
            The availability of skilled labor can also impact the timeline. In
            some cases, strikes or holidays can delay the project.
          </p>
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> Material Shortages:
          </span>
          <p>
            In times of high demand, materials like cement, steel, or tiles may
            become scarce, leading to delays in construction.
          </p>

            Changes in Design:
          </span>
          <p>
            {" "}
            If you decide to make significant changes to the design midway
            through construction, it could cause delays in both the approvals
            and execution stages.

          <p>
            Delays in obtaining permits or addressing legal issues related to
            land ownership or zoning can also hold up the construction process.{" "}
