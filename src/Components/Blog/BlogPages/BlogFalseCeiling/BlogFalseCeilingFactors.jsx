        can vary significantly depending on several factors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <h4>1. Type of Material</h4>

          </span>
          <p>
            The material you choose is the biggest factor affecting the cost.
            Common materials for false ceilings include:
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> Gypsum Board:
          </span>
          <p>Popular for its lightweight nature and smooth finish.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> Plaster of Paris (POP):
          </span>
          <p>Affordable and versatile for intricate designs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> Wooden Panels:
          </span>
          <p>Adds a luxurious and natural feel but comes at a higher price.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> Metal:
          </span>
          <p>Durable and suitable for industrial or contemporary designs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> PVC Panels:
          </span>
          <p>
            Low-cost and moisture-resistant, making them ideal for kitchens and
            bathrooms.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h4>2. Design Complexity</h4>
        <p>
          Simple, flat designs cost less compared to intricate patterns, layered
          designs, or customized shapes. If youâ€™re opting for elaborate cove
          lighting or 3D effects, expect the costs to go up.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h4>3. Area Size</h4>
        <p>
          The larger the area to be covered, the higher the total cost. Most
          contractors in Bangalore charge per square foot, so the size of the
          room plays a crucial role in determining the overall expense.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h4>4. Lighting Integration</h4>
        <p>
          Adding recessed lights, LED strips, or decorative chandeliers to your
          false ceiling design will increase costs. However, the right lighting
          can significantly enhance the look and feel of your space.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h4>5. Labour Costs</h4>
        <p>
          Labour charges in Bangalore can vary depending on the contractor or
          interior design firm you choose. Skilled labour for more complex
          designs often comes at a premium.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h4>6. Location and Accessibility</h4>
        <p>
          If your property is in a congested area or has limited accessibility,
          the transportation and installation costs may be slightly higher.
        </p>
